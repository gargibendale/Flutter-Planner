# study_planner

A new Flutter project. And, it's completely basic! What I did is integrate Firebase with Flutter in order to create a back-end system where the study plan of the user gets stored as a note. Furthermore, api calls are made to fetch and display the stored data - but in a creative and eye-catching manner. It makes you want to plan every minute of your day! That's just how good the UI/UX is. And if not the design, then what is Flutter for?

## Getting Started
